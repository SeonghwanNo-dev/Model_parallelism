# 1. IPC (Inter-Process Communication) Component Design Document (cpp)

1. Introduction
 This document defines the design and specifications for the Inter-Process Communication (IPC) component within the system. The IPC component aims to manage stable connections with other processes (nodes) and provide functionality for sending and receiving data between connected nodes.
 
2. IPC Component Properties
- connected_nodeNode, type: Object (e.g., IPCNode)
The currently connected node object. Indicates the connection status.
- connected_node_addressString (e.g., IP:Port)
The network address (IP and port number) of the currently connected node.

3. Method Specifications
  3.1 Node Connection (ConnectNode)
  This function attempts to establish a network connection between the IPC component and a target node.
  - Input: Target Node Address (target_address: String)
  - Output: None
  - Operation
  1. An attempt is made to establish a network connection to the node specified by target_address.
  2. On Success: The connected_node and connected_node_address properties are updated, and the following message is printed.
  > Output Message (Success): "Connection success, Connected Node is xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx:xxx"
  3. On Failure: The properties are not updated, and the following message is printed:> Output Message (Failure): "Connection fail"
  
  3.2 Check Current Connection (CheckConnection)
  This function checks and outputs the information of the node currently connected to the IPC component.
  - Input: None
  - Output: None
  - Operation
  1. The values of the connected_node and connected_node_address properties are checked.
  2. If a node is connected: The connected node object information and address are printed.
  > Output Message (Connected): "Current connected node: [connected_node_object], Address: [connected_node_address]"
  3. If no node is connected: A no connection status message is printed.
  > Output Message (No Connection): "No connected node currently."

  3.3 Data Transmission (TransmitData)
  This function transmits data to the currently connected node.
  - Input: Data to Transmit (data: Data Type) <- 파이토치에서 정의된 형식, 아마 데이터 로더 관련돼있을거임
  - Output: None
  - Operation
  1. Confirms that the current connected_node is valid.
  2. Transmits the data to the connected node.
  3. Upon Data Transmission Completion, the following message is printed.
  > Output Message (Completion): "Data transmission complete."
  4. Upon Transmission Failure (e.g., connection loss), a failure message is printed.
  > Output Message (Failure): "Data transmission failed. Connection may be lost."

# 2. Model Partitioning Component Design Document (py)

1. Introduction
 This document specifies the design for the Model Partitioning component. This component is designed to encapsulate a single neural network model, providing basic functionality for model initialization, structure introspection, and partitioning (cutting) the model at a specific layer index.
 
2. Model Partitioning Component Properties
- model, type: Neural Network Model Object
The single model object currently managed by the component. This property is initially None until a model is loaded.

3. Method Specifications
  3.1 Load Model (LoadModel)
  This method initializes the component by setting the internal model property.
  - Input: input_model (input_model: Original Neural Network Model Object)
  - Output: None
  - Operation
  1. Assigns the input_model to the component's internal model property.
  2. Output Message: "Model successfully loaded."
  
  3.2 Check Model(CheckModel)
  This method checks whether a model has been successfully loaded into the component.
  Note: This method is primarily intended for internal component use.
  - Input: None
  - Output: Boolean (is_loaded: True if model is not None, False otherwise)
  - Operation	
  1. Returns True if the component's internal model property is not None.
  2. Returns False otherwise.

  3.3 Display Model Structure (DisplayStructure)
  This method outputs a detailed summary or textual representation of the currently managed model's architecture.
  - Input: None
  - Output: None
  - Operation
  1. Calls the CheckModel (3.2) method to verify if the model is loaded.
  2. If valid: Iterates through the model's layers and prints key structural information (e.g., Layer Name, Input/Output Shape, Number of Parameters).
  3. If invalid: Prints an error message.
  > Output Message (No Model): "Error: No model loaded. Use LoadModel first."
  > Output Message (Example): `"[Layer Index]
  
  3.4 Partition Model (PartitionModel)
  This method splits the managed model into two sequential blocks (Block 1 and Block 2) using a specified layer index as the cut point.
  - Input: Cut Index (cut_index: Integer)
  - OutputTuple: (Block 1, Block 2) ((block1, block2): Tuple of Model Blocks)
  - Operation
  1. Calls the CheckModel (3.2) method to verify if the model is loaded.
  2. Create Block 1: Groups layers from the start up to the layer before the cut_index.
  3. Create Block 2: Groups layers starting from the layer at the cut_index up to the end of the model.
  4. Returns the resulting tuple (block1, block2).
  5. Error Handling (Invalid Index): If the index is invalid, raise a standard exception (e.g., IndexError) and output a message.
  > Output Message (Error): "Partitioning failed: Invalid cut index or no model loaded.
